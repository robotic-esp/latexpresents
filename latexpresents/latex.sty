%%% A helper function to define complementary keys (i.e., key1 != key2)
%
% Usage: \definecomplementarykeys{prefix}{keyfamily}{key1}{key2}
%
% Generates keys of the form: pre@fam@key1 and pre@fam@key2 as would be created by:
%   \define@boolkey[prefix]{keyfamily}{key1}[true]{}
%   \define@boolkey[prefix]{keyfamily}{key2}[true]{}
% but tied such that they are mutually exclusive

    {%
        \in@{true}{##1}% ##1 is the true/false arugment to the key
